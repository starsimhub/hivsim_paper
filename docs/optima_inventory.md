# Optima HIV Malawi: component inventory

Source: `files/Malawi_20220912.prj`, run on Optima HIV 2.12.2 (`~/src/optima`, conda env `optima`). The project was saved by Optima 2.11.4 on 12 Sep 2022 (branch `updates-june-2022`). Reference run and outputs: `optima_ref/run_optima.py`.

## Project contents

- **One parameter set** (`20220912`). This is the calibrated model, and the only thing that is run.
- **The program set is empty.** No cost or coverage curves, so nothing is driven by budgets. Coverage comes straight from the databook.
- **One scenario** (`default`), a parameter scenario with no overrides, so it is the same as the baseline.
- **One optimisation** (outcomes, 2020–2030, weights: incidence 1, deaths 5). It can't run usefully without programs.

The thing to rebuild is therefore the epidemic model plus its databook inputs. There is no programs layer.

## Structure

- Deterministic compartmental model, 1990–2030, dt = 0.2 years. Run time 0.5 s.
- **39 populations**: FSW, Clients and MSM (all aged 15–49), plus 36 general populations (F/M by 5-year age band from 0–4 to 85+).
  - Ageing moves people between bands (`agerate`, `agetransit`).
  - There are risk transitions between populations (`risktransit`, 14 nonzero entries).
  - Births go into the 0–4 bands (`birthtransit`).
  - Population sizes are forced to follow the input (`forcepopsize = 1`).
- **Infection stages (6)**: acute, CD4 >500, >350, >200, >50, <50.
- **Care states (8)**: susceptible, circumcised susceptible, undiagnosed, diagnosed, in care, lost to follow-up, on ART unsuppressed, on ART suppressed.
- **No migration**: emigration and immigration are zero.

## Components and their inputs

## Fit to data (reference run)

- Population size and number on ART match the data almost exactly. The ART match is by construction.
- PLHIV fits well (1.13M in 2020).
- HIV deaths have the right shape, but the peak is too low (about 57k modelled against 71k).
- New infections are too low before 2000 (about 85k against 110k at the peak) and slightly too high from 2012 to 2018.
- Prevalence: the data series is adult prevalence. The model's 15–49 prevalence is 11.6% in 1999 against 15.2% in the data, and 8.8% in 2020 against 8.1%. So the model's early peak is too low, which is consistent with its low early incidence.

## Implications for Optima′

- With no programs layer, the rebuild only covers the epidemic model plus the databook time series.
- Several parameters are calibration scale factors, not biology: `force`, `inhomo`, `transnorm`, `initprev`. They have to carry over exactly as values, not be recalibrated.
- From 2020, projections hold the cascade proportions fixed (`fixproptx`, `fixpropsupp`). The treatment-interruption scenario has to change these rules, so they are part of the scenario interface.
- The cascade (linkage, loss to follow-up, return to care) is the main structural gap with HIVsim. See the seam spike notes.

## Time-step dependence (30 Oct)

The calibrated Optima Malawi model is a discrete-time model at dt = 0.2, and its results are not converged in dt (`optima_ref/dt_study.py`). Maximum relative difference from dt = 0.2, 2000–2030:

| dt | PLHIV | New infections | HIV deaths | Diagnosed | On ART |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0.1 | 3.6% | 15.1% | 23.4% | 3.1% | 4.1% |
| 0.05 | 7.4% | 31.0% | 43.9% | 6.2% | 5.6% |
| 0.02 | 10.6% | 46.0% | 64.8% | 8.8% | 7.6% |

Before ART scale-up (to 2005) the differences are at most 7%. Most of the rest is one mechanism:

- **Viral suppression on ART is a step-size artefact.** People starting ART go straight to suppressed with probability `1 - exp(-dt/treatvs)` (`model.py:1057`). With `treatvs` = 0.2 y that is 63% at dt = 0.2. The only other route from unsuppressed to suppressed is viral load monitoring (`numvlmon`), which starts in 2009.4 and is small until about 2011. So the share of people on ART who are suppressed in 2006–2010 is 0.65 at dt = 0.2, 0.42 at dt = 0.1 and 0.11 at dt = 0.02.
- Holding that share at 63% (`treatvs = dt`) cuts the gap at dt = 0.02 to 16% for new infections and 12% for deaths after 2005, and 3–8% before. Other step-dependent pieces remain, not yet identified. Candidates: rates used directly as probabilities (`hivtest*dt`, `leavecare*dt`, `treatfail*dt`, death rates), the cascade-proportion rules, and the old ageing code (project version 2.11.4 < 2.12.0, `model.py:891`).

Consequence for P2: a continuous-time ODE re-expression cannot be within 2% of Optima at dt = 0.2 unless these discrete-step behaviours are reproduced or made explicit.

### Making the step explicit (option 1, 30 Oct)

`optima_ref/model_dt.py` is a copy of Optima's `model.py` (2.12.2) with switches (`FIX`) that make the calibrated step (`REF_DT = 0.2`) explicit, and `optima_ref/dt_fix.py` measures them. Every switch is the identity at dt = 0.2 (equal to the original to 3e-8 people). Following Robyn's decision (30 Oct), the comparison covers only years with treatment data, **2000–2020**.

**The rule that works: read everything Optima does in one 0.2-year step as rate × 0.2.** At a smaller step, each step is built exactly as Optima builds a 0.2-year step (transitions, infections, births and PMTCT diagnosis, circumcision, ageing, risk transitions), and dt/0.2 of the change is taken (`FIX = {'linear'}`). The inputs are Optima's own dt = 0.2 series, interpolated between 0.2-year points (`'inputs'`), because Optima smooths inputs over `int(1/dt)` points, so the series themselves change with the step. Population forcing and the ART and cascade targets act on levels and are applied unchanged.

Max difference from the calibrated run at dt = 0.01 (converged: dt = 0.02 differs by < 0.15 points):

| Years | PLHIV | New infections | HIV deaths | Diagnosed | On ART | Suppressed |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2000–2019 | 0.7% | 1.2% | 1.4% | 0.8% | 0.4% | 0.3% |
| 2020 | 0.6% | 2.0% | 2.5% | 0.6% | 0.0% | 0.2% |

The 2020 step (new infections −1.0% in 2019, −2.0% in 2020, and the same beyond) coincides with the cascade proportions being frozen in 2020 (`fixproptx`, `fixpropsupp`). Not yet explained.

What the rule captures, found on the way (`dt_fix.py` keeps the per-group switches):

- **Suppression at ART start** is 63%, the per-step chance `1-exp(-0.2/treatvs)`, with no other route to suppression until viral load monitoring starts (2009.4). This is the largest single effect.
- **Every stage takes at least one step.** Someone leaving a stage partway through a step starts the next one only at the step's end, so a stay of tau lasts 0.2/p ≈ tau + 0.1 y. Acute infection lasts 0.35 y, not 0.24, and CD4 > 500 lasts 1.05 y, not 0.95. At small steps without this, there are 0.70× as many people in acute infection and 0.90× in CD4 > 500 before ART, and people reach CD4 < 50 sooner, so deaths are 7% higher per untreated person.
- **Competing risks favour death.** Within a step, death comes first and every other move applies only to survivors (probabilities multiplied by `1 - death*dt`).
- **Ageing can skip a band.** In the old ageing code (project version 2.11.4), people who age into a band can age out of it in the same step.
- **Rates used as probabilities** (`r*dt`: testing, care, deaths) are already rates under this reading and need no conversion.

Per-group conversions (time in state for exponential stays, survival for `r*dt` rules) got to a similar fit (1.6% new infections, 1.1% deaths, 4.2% on ART), but only with a mix of rules and no reason for the mix. The linear reading explains it: the survival conversion of deaths and ageing was standing in for competing risks and the ageing skip.

**Decided (Robyn, 30 Oct): Optima′ keeps Optima's handling of time, quirks included.**

**Consequence for Optima′.** Its continuous-time rates are Optima's per-step probabilities at dt = 0.2 divided by 0.2, with Optima's product structure: progression and cascade rates reduced by the chance of dying in the step, direct transitions where Optima allows two moves in one step (diagnosed and progressed, two age bands), the infection probability per 0.2 y divided by 0.2, and suppression at ART start a fixed 63%. Inputs are Optima's dt = 0.2 series. Population forcing and the ART and cascade targets are rules on levels, applied each step.

### Projections are ill-conditioned (30 Oct)

After 2019, new infections and deaths amplify small differences. In the original model, raising `force` by 0.5% changes new infections by +1.8% in 2015 and +12% in 2030, and deaths by +1.3% and +15%. PLHIV changes by only 0.9% and 2.1%. The likely reason: the number on ART does not respond (+0.3%), so the extra people with HIV stay untreated. By 2030 about 0.15M of 1.22M PLHIV are untreated, and they produce most of the new infections and deaths.

Consequence for P2: "within 2% for every output, 2000–2040" can't be met for new infections and deaths in projection years by any re-expression. A difference of 0.1% in PLHIV becomes about 1.5% in 2030 incidence. **Decided (Robyn, 30 Oct): compare only over the years with treatment data (2000–2020).** The published MIHPSA projections must have extended treatment beyond 2020 somehow; waiting on Rowan.
